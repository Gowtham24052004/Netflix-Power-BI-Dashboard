# Netflix Shows & Movies Dashboard (Power BI)

This is a single-page Power BI dashboard that analyzes the complete Netflix library of movies and TV shows.

## 🚀 Project Goal
The goal of this project was to analyze the Netflix dataset to find key trends. The dashboard answers questions like:
* What is the most common content rating (e.g., TV-MA, R)?
* What are the most popular genres?
* Where is most of the content produced?
* How has the volume of content changed over the years?
